# PISA DATA EXPLORATION
## by Sinem Mutluer


## Dataset

I used Pisa 2012 Data which provided by Udacity for this project. PISA is abbrevation of Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA is a worldwide study developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which examines the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world. The study assesses students’ mathematics, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students’ background, their school and the organisation of education systems.
There were 485490 students in the dataset. There were 636 columns in the dataset and lots of them had detailed information that will not be used for this project so i removed them and create new dataframe just includes 30 columns.


## Summary of Findings

Q1) How is the gender distribution?

A1) Female and male student counts are close to each other so it's possible to have a sensible analyze about gender.

Q2) From which countries students attended more?

A2) Mexico,Italy,Spain,Canada,Brazil have students over 15000.They have the biggest part of the data.

Q3) How are the skills' score distribution?

A3) - All scores have normal distribution.

-Lots of students have scores between 400 and 600. Genaral trend of scores for all the skills is between 300 - 700.

-There are some students who have reading score under the point of 100 and math score over the point of 800.But the number of those students is low.

Q4) Is there any relationship with math interest and math score?

A4) There isn't exact relationship between Math Interest and Math Score. Even if students's interests is minus, they are able to get the score in general trend.

Q5) Is there any relationship between parents who like math and student math score?

A5) There is no strong relationship between student math socres with their parents' math interest. Students are able to be successful in math even if their parents don't know or don't like math.

Q6) Is there any relationship between internet usage and student skills? 

A6) Internet usage have some affect on skills. We can say the students who use internet for research can get more points on all skills.

Q7) Which gender is more tend to the skills?

A7) Male students more succesful on all skills

Q8) Does teacher change have an effect on student scores?

A8) We can't exactly say that teacher change have an affect on math score. But when it comes to science and reading, we can see that if theacher changes, scores go over. We can say that math has more standart parameters while teaching. Science may differ from math about perspective. Different teachers might show different ways of perspective. For reading, interaction with different people makes learning more easy so if teacher changes, interaction increases.

Q9) Is there any correlation between scores of skills?

A9) There is a strong positive correlation between skills. We can say that each skill are related to each other somehow.

Q10) How teaching types affect student skills?

A10) - Math scores are better when students study individual. Students learn math more when they are in the class.

-Work with groups doesn't the best way to improve reading skill. Homeworks may create good affect on skills if they are not given by teachers very frequently.

-Both small group and large group works are very useful for science. Homeworks also increase their skills if they are not given every day. Everyone needs break sometimes.
